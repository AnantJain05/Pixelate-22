This is the code that won us Pixelate-2k19, an image processing event with a hardware implementation for a ludo like maze.

Pixelate is an event under **TECHNEX**, the annual Techo-Management fest of IIT (BHU) Varanasi.


**Problem Statement**: Pixelate of Technex 2019, expected us to develop a robot for playing a ludo like game using the live feed from an overhead webcam feed. The detailed problem statement of **Pixelate-2019** can be found here - [Robonex_Pixelate.pdf](https://github.com/nishantkr18/Pixelate-2k19-Technex/blob/master/Robonex_Pixelate.pdf)
